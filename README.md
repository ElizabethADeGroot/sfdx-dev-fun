### Assets

#### Triggers

* AccountUpdate </br>
Description: Post chatter message on a specific group with account information when specific criteria on Account is met.
Purpose: This trigger is really unnecessary. This could be better handled in a flow IMO. I needed a simple trigger because I have written content on how to properly structure code. Such as bulkify the soql pull, don't have DML statements in a FOR loop... etc. As useless as this trigger is, it was a bit of fun to create.
